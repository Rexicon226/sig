Before you start contributing, please take a moment to read and understand this Contributing Guidelines document. It will help you get started and ensure a smooth collaboration process.

## Dev Environment Setup

See the [readme](../readme.md#-setup).

## Style Guide

### Optional Values

- optional values should be prepended with `maybe_` and unwrapping should follow the `if (maybe_x) |x| {}` format
- for example:

```zig
fn do_something(maybe_foo: ?Foo) void {
    if (maybe_foo) |foo| {
        // do something with foo here
  }
}
```

### Function Signatures

- if passing an `Allocator` as a parameter, it should be the first parameter of the function
- if the number of possible errors which a function can return is reasonably small (eg, can only fail on memory allocations), then the error types should be explicit (eg, `error{ OutOfMemory }`) instead of using `anyerror` and the `!` operator
- if a parameter is not modified, then it should be `const` (eg, `fn get(*const Self)`)

### Slices

- when converting an array from a slice, the syntax `&buf` should be used instead of `buf[0..]`

### Writing Tests

- when writing tests the naming convention is: `test "{path to file}: {test name}"`
  - for example, in `src/gossip/data.zig` a test is defined as `test "gossip.data: test label() and id() methods"`

### Linting

- run `zig fmt src/` in the top-level directory to run the zig linter
